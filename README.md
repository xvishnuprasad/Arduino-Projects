## 🔧 How to Install the Software and Set Up the Files

### Prerequisites
1. **Arduino IDE**: Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) on your computer.
2. **Drivers**: Ensure you have the necessary drivers installed for your Arduino board (check the Arduino website for guidance).

### Installation Steps
1. **Download the Repository**:
   - Clone the repository or download the ZIP file:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/xvishnuprasad/DSA-Project.git
     ```
   - Extract the ZIP file if you downloaded it.

2. **Open the Arduino IDE**:
   - Launch the Arduino IDE on your computer.
   - Navigate to `File > Open` and select the appropriate `.ino` file for the project you want to run.

3. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Some projects may require additional libraries. Go to `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries`, then search for and install the necessary libraries (e.g., for LCD displays or ultrasonic sensors).

### Setting Up the Files
1. **Connect Your Arduino Board**:
   - Plug your Arduino board into your computer using a USB cable.
2. **Select the Board and Port**:
   - In the Arduino IDE, go to `Tools > Board` and select your board (e.g., Arduino Uno).
   - Go to `Tools > Port` and select the correct port your board is connected to.
3. **Upload the Code**:
   - Click the upload button (right arrow icon) to compile and upload the code to your Arduino board.
   - Ensure that the code compiles successfully without errors.

## 🚀 Running the Projects

1. **Assemble the Circuit**:
   - Use a breadboard and wires to connect your sensors and actuators to the Arduino as specified in the project description.
   - Double-check your connections to avoid short circuits.

2. **Monitor the Output**:
   - Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (`Tools > Serial Monitor`) to view real-time data from your sensors.
   - Adjust any settings or thresholds in the code as needed.

3. **Enjoy Your Smart System!**
   - Observe how the system behaves and make any necessary tweaks to improve performance.
